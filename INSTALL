Installation Guide
==================

This document will put you through the installation steps for django-onetime.


Configuration
-------------

1. Add the authentication backend of this django-onetime application to your
   project's ``settings.py``

        AUTHENTICATION_BACKENDS = (
            'django.contrib.auth.backends.ModelBackend',
            'onetime.backends.OneTimeBackend',
        )
   
   The first authentication backend is the default and if your project uses the
   Django's standard authentication mechanism, you will need that.

   Consult the Django documentation for more information regarding the backend.
   http://docs.djangoproject.com/en/dev/topics/auth/#other-authentication-sources


2. Include the application's ``urls.py`` to your project.

        urlpatterns = patterns('',
            ...
            (r'^onetime/', include('onetime.urls')),
            ...
        )
    
   This will make requests to ``onetime/`` are handled by django-onetime. If
   the configuration is put inside the project's ``urls.py``, the log in URL
   will look like the following.

       http://example.com/onetime/a-secret-key


Scheduled Task
--------------

To keep your database clean from expired secret keys, a scheduled task need to
be set up. This task should do one of the following.

1. Call ``onetime_cleanup`` command from the Django's management script.

2. Open a special URL that will trigger the clean up, ``onetime/cleanup/``.
   e.g. http://example.com/onetime/cleanup/

You can use crontab or the web based one to set this up. A daily or weekly task
should be enough.


Usage
-----

If your application need to create a one time log in URL, what you need to do
is calling ``onetime.utils.create`` with a user object as the parameter. The
resulting object is an instance of ``onetime.models.Key`` that has a property
called ``key`` that contains a unique key for the log in URL.

    import onetime.utils

    def create_login_url(user):
        key = onetime.utils.create(user)
        url = 'http://example.com/onetime/%s' % key.key

        return url
