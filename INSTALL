Installation Guide
==================

This document will put you through the installation steps for django-onetime.


Configuration
-------------

1. Add the authentication backend of this django-onetime application to your
   project's ``settings.py``

        AUTHENTICATION_BACKENDS = (
            'django.contrib.auth.backends.ModelBackend',
            'onetime.backends.OneTimeBackend',
        )
   
   The first authentication backend is the default and if your project uses the
   Django's standard authentication mechanism, you will need that.

   Consult the Django documentation for more information regarding the backend.
   http://docs.djangoproject.com/en/dev/topics/auth/#other-authentication-sources


2. Include the application's ``urls.py`` to your project.

        urlpatterns = patterns('',
            ...
            (r'^onetime/', include('onetime.urls')),
            ...
        )
    
   This will make requests to ``onetime/`` are handled by django-onetime. If
   the configuration is put inside the project's ``urls.py``, the log in URL
   will look like the following.

       http://example.com/onetime/a-secret-key


Scheduled Task
--------------

To keep your database clean from expired secret keys, a scheduled task need to
be set up. This task should do one of the following.

1. Call ``onetime_cleanup`` command from the Django's management script.

2. Open a special URL that will trigger the clean up, ``onetime/cleanup/``.
   e.g. http://example.com/onetime/cleanup/

You can use crontab or the web based one to set this up. A daily or weekly task
should be enough.
