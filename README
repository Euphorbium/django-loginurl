Django One-Time Login URL
=========================

This is a simple application for Django that allows an anonymous visitor to log
in as a user by only visiting a URL. 

By default, the URL is only valid once and cannot be used multiple times. Other
schemes that involve the number of visit and/or an expiry date can also be
created. For example, it is possible to create a log in URL that only valid for
5 visits before next week using this application.

See the file "INSTALL" for installation instruction.
